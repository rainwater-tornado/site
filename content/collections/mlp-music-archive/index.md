Torrents from the [MLP Music Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mlpmusicarchive.com/), which was active from 2012 to 2013 (with a separate release, possibly from a different party, in 2015).

**Help Wanted**: Rainwater Tornado is not seeding Version 13 or any of the "other collections" listed because no other seeds or file downloads are available. If you have any of these torrents, please consider seeding them.

## Sources

Version 16 is from the [Brony Music Archive's Tumblr post](https://bronymusicarchive.tumblr.com/post/111424776817/brony-music-archive-deleted-music-collection). (It's unclear if this is actually related to the previous versions, but it's included here for convenience.)

Versions 15 and 14 are from [Ponyville Live!](https://ponyvillelive.com/mlpma/)

Version 13 is from an [archive of mlpmusicarchive.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121208221301/http://mlpmusicarchive.com/archive-updates/update-v013-the-5k-update). (Version 14 is also available from a [different archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20130330071328/http://mlpmusicarchive.com/the-archive).)

## Other Collections

There are additional collections listed on an [archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20130330071328/http://mlpmusicarchive.com/the-archive) on mlpmusicarchive.com (also of interest is an [archived page on EverfreeForest.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120130165743/http://everfreeforest.com/music-archive/)). However, these collections are considered "lost" because many of the download links are broken. Any help in recovering these collections is appreciated.
