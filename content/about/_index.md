Rainwater Tornado preserves archives and collections of My Little Pony fan music. However, unlike other projects, Rainwater Tornado's goal isn't to create one giant super-archive; rather, it's to preserve existing collections as they are.

The main job of this project is to seed collections of music through BitTorrent. People don't always have their computers running 24/7 to seed their torrents, so Rainwater Tornado acts as a backup.

## A Little Background on BitTorrent

BitTorrent works by downloading data from multiple other computers on the Internet that have the same file (called a "torrent"); these other computers are said to be "seeding" the file. This system makes the file more accessible because the download isn't tied to a single location (like a file-hosting website), which could become unavailable.

To download a file from BitTorrent, you need a program called a BitTorrent client. There are many available; one popular option is [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/).

## Who's Running This

This site is operated by [Jack "Fox" Grayson](https://www.jackgraysonfox.xyz/), a musician and music lover in the brony fandom.

## How to Help

New collections, donations, and technical advice. Get the details on [how to help]({{< relref "how-to-help" >}}) make this archive better.
