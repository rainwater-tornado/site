## New Collections

New collections are always welcome. These include:

* Other archives
* Community albums
* Artist collections

Of particular interest are any collections that are less well-known or at risk of being lost.

Existing torrents are good, but they can be direct downloads as well.

To suggest a new collection, please e-mail <jackgraysonfox@gmail.com>. Be sure to include a link to a torrent or download source.

## Help Wanted on Existing Collections

The [Help Wanted]({{< relref "/tags/help-wanted" >}}) tag is for any collections that require assistance, so consider checking the tag and helping out where you can.

## Donations

Running this isn't cheap, and the cost grows when more collections are added. If you can, please consider [buying some "coffee" on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jackgraysonfox) to help offset the costs. (If you include Rainwater Tornado in your note I will reserve the proceeds specifically for the costs associated with this project.)

## Technical Assistance

* You can seed these torrents on your own computer for added resilience. The [updates section]({{< relref "/updates" >}}) lists any new torrents.
* The server infrastructure is described [on GitHub](https://github.com/rainwater-tornado/technical). If you have any ideas for how to improve the server infrastructure, open an issue there or e-mail <jackgraysonfox@gmail.com>.
* The website is also [on GitHub](https://github.com/rainwater-tornado/site). If you have any ideas for how to improve the website, open an issue or pull request there.
